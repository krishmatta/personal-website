Hi, I'm Krish Matta.

# About Me

## Work
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematical sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. I have previously worked for or collaborated with:
- [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) (2024).
- [University of Delaware Safro Research Group](https://safroresearch.blogspot.com/) (2021 - 2023).
- [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) (2023).
- [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/) (2022).

## Interests
Academically, I'm interested in computer science and mathematics, with a particular interest in artificial intelligence safety. Casually, I enjoy nature and reading.

# About the Site
This website is a digital garden, a space where my ideas grow and evolve organically. Unlike a traditional blog, digital gardens heavily emphasize interlinkage between notes as well as constant refinement, meaning that notes may change at any moment.

My writing is organized into two main sections:
- [Main](/main/) contains my original thoughts, such as book reviews and independent research.
- [Reference](/reference/) contains my notes on the works of others, such as lecture notes and research paper summaries.

Navigating the above may be daunting. Thus, I recommend first viewing my work through the [Highlights](/main/highlights) as an entry point. It consists of work that I feel is particularly accessible, and is more akin to an article list on a traditional blog you may be more familiar with.
