Notes consist of spontaneous thoughts I've decided to write down and publish. Consequently, spelling mistakes and uninformed opinions may be present. I've separated my notes into two pages:
- [Main Notes](/main/): Notes on my original thoughts.
- [Reference Notes](/reference/): Notes on the works of others.
