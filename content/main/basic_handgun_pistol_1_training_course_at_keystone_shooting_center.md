After twenty years of no exposure to firearms, I decided to learn handgun basics in the motivation of self defense. Based on online recommendations, I participated in the Basic Handgun - Pistol 1 Training Course at [Keystone Shooting Center](https://keystoneshootingcenter.com/) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on November 23rd, 2024.


## Classroom Instruction {#classroom-instruction}

The first two hours of the course take place in the classroom, where the instructor presents a slideshow related to handgun anatomy, firearm safety, and basic shooting form. Differences between the types of handguns, like revolver vs. semi-auto and single action vs. double action vs. striker fired are all explained. The basic components of a handgun are covered, and all students are given a Glock 47 (unloaded, of course) to physically inspect. Safety is taken very seriously: common sense firearm safety rules like "always treat a gun as if it were loaded until you inspect it yourself" are repeatedly drilled. The modified athletic stance of firing and proper handgun grip are also demonstrated.


## Range Practice {#range-practice}

The last hour of the course is reserved for range practice. Students are given the opportunity to fire fifty rounds of ammunition using a Glock 47 at targets of distances of 3 yards and 4 yards, the most common scenarios in which one would have to use a handgun for defense.

I had a lot of difficulty firing my first shot. Due to my complete lack of familiarity, I was afraid of the potential recoil and wasn't sure how tightly I should hold the gun, or whether it would go flying when I squeezed the trigger. After this first shot, however, firing the future rounds only became easier and easier. I definitely noticed that 9mm handguns have much more recoil than one would expect after only being exposed to firearms through media.

While I certainly can't say I left the range being able to shoot well, having this hour of experience definitely made me more comfortable with actually firing a handgun. That is not to say I am now not nervous with handling firearms; as my instructor says, the day you don't feel fear when picking up a handgun is the day you need to leave it behind, simply because of how dangerous it is as a weapon.


## Overall Thoughts {#overall-thoughts}

My thoughts on the course are overall mixed and may be somewhat controversial. I booked the course because many online said to start off with a similar course, but I didn't leave feeling like I learned something I couldn't have learned on my own or through self-scheduled range practice. In particular, I was hoping to have more instructor guided range practice, but due to the size of the course (~12 people), that proved to be impossible. Much of the classroom instruction seemed to be either common sense or something easily learnable online.

I do understand, however, the need of such a course. Because of the danger handguns impose to life, it's much safer to have a basic course than to instead expect people to learn the basics themself and potentially put people's lives in danger.

It's difficult for me to provide a blanket recommendation, but to be safe, if you have any doubt at all in your ability to learn how to fire a handgun safely, I would recommend taking a similar beginner course if possible.
