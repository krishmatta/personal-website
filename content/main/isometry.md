An isometry is a bijective function between metric spaces that preserves distances. Formally, a bijective function \\(f: M\_1 \rightarrow M\_2\\) is an isometry if and only if for all \\(x, y \in M\_1\\), \\(d\_1(x, y) = d\_2(f(x), f(y))\\).


## Geometric Intepretation {#geometric-intepretation}

In Euclidean space, isometries act like a rigid motion: when applied to a set of points, the isometry treats the set as a [rigid body]({{< relref "rigid_body.md" >}}). Examples include transformations, rotations, and reflections.
