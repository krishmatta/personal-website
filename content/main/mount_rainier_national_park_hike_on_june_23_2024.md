The night before this hike, my parents and I spontaneously decided to make the 2 hour drive from Bellevue to Mount Rainier National Park to see the sunrise at 5AM. I didn't sleep before we left at ~1:30AM, getting a cumulative one hour of sleep in the car. Originally we planned to observe the sunrise from the Sunrise Visitor Center, but after driving for 1.5 hours, we discovered that the remaining road was closed. Rather than turn back, we parked at the White River Campground and attempted to find a trail to hike to a nearby viewpoint. Since there was no cellular signal, we could only rely on the paper map provided at the campground, and decided to begin hiking the Wonderland trail.

After hiking for 2.2 miles, we reached a point where the much of the trail was covered with snow. Due to improper gear (we weren't expecting to hike in the first place), we were unfortunately forced to turn back. These 2.2 miles were pretty challenging due to elevation, but I think lack of sleep played a large factor in this difficulty. In total, we hiked 4.4 miles.
