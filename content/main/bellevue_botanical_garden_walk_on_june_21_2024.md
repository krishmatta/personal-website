My sister and I decided to drive to the Bellevue Botanical Gardens and walk there. It was my first time visiting, but I've heard many things about it being a great place to visit in Bellevue. We didn't explore the entire garden thoroughly due to time, but from what we saw the garden was quite large. Overall, a great place to walk and take pictures.
